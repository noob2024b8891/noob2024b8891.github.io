# Privacy and Compliance Policy

This Privacy and Compliance Policy outlines how our Google app handles user data, prioritizing local storage and user control. It applies to all users accessing health profile features.

# Definitions

Device Storage: The primary repository for all user data, consisting of encrypted local storage on the user's device (e.g., via secure app sandboxing on Android).

# Data Collection and Usage

1. Users voluntarily provide health profile information, such as medical history or wellness data, directly within the app.
2. No data is collected without explicit user input, and all entries remain confined to Device Storage.
3. The app processes this data solely for on-device features like profile viewing and analysis, with no transmission to external servers.

# No Selling or Sharing of Data

Because the app operates without a server-side database, we cannot and do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.
All Sensitive Data stays encrypted on the user's device, ensuring zero monetization or external access.

# Children's Privacy

1. This app is intended for adults 18 years or older.
2. If used for a child's health profile, parental or guardian supervision is required at all times, with caregivers responsible for data entry and management.

# Security and HIPAA Considerations

1. Data is secured using local encryption to protect Sensitive Data at rest and in use.
2. Minimal data transit occurs (e.g., none beyond device boundaries), aligning with HIPAA Technical Safeguards principles like access controls and encryption, though as an independent developer app, we are not a Covered Entity under HIPAA.
3. Users are encouraged to enable device-level security features like biometric locks.

# User Rights and Controls

1. Users can view, edit, or delete their health profile data anytime via app settings, with immediate local removal.
2. For support or questions, contact us at [insert support email]. This policy is effective February 2026 and subject to updates.
